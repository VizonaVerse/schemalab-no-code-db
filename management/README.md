# Project Management

Hi Saker (:
Here's a quick reminder of a few things:
- You will need to communicate with the frontend team to figure out what Management API requests will be required
- You can use Django or Express for this, use whichever you're more comfotable with
- You should be able to set up the Django/Express project in this directory yourself, let us know if you need a hand
- The database is intended to be written in postgres, but for now just focus on the database schema
