# Schema Building

Hi Jess (:
Here's a brief summary of the system we need to create:
The Frontend will send us the format of no-code database schema the user has created, this data will be in our own JSON format and its our job to covert this into an actual usable database schema or file and return it to the Frontend, so the backend we'll be creating will likely be one giant script to process one request

Setup commands:
- npm install
- npm run dev
